# What is Safe Harbor?

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles">Safe Harbor</a> is an agreement that thousands of U.S. businesses (including PASS Training & Compliance) have relied on for the transatlantic transfer of personal data from the European Union.

## Where does PASS Training & Compliance keep my data?

When you use PASS Training & Compliance, you connect to PASS Training & Compliance’s servers in the U.S. and voluntarily provide all the data you transmit to PASS Training & Compliance’s servers in the U.S.

## I heard there were changes to Safe Harbor. What happened to Safe Harbor?

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/technology/european-union-us-data-collection.html?_r=0">On Oct 6, 2015</a>, the CJEU _(Court of Justice of the European Union)_ issued a <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2015-10/cp150117en.pdf">press release</a> describing its ruling invalidating the rules that allowed transfers under the Safe Harbor agreement.

On July 12, 2016, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework was approved to replace the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework. PASS Training & Compliance complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. See our [EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield policy](/privacy/privacy-shield.md).

## What does this mean to me as a PASS Training & Compliance customer?

If your company is in the U.S. and only uses PASS Training & Compliance to transact business in the U.S. with non-EU citizens, the Privacy Shield and Safe Harbor agreements do not apply to you and you don't need to do anything.

If you live in the European Union and store personal data in your PASS Training & Compliance account, or you use your PASS Training & Compliance account to do business with EU residents who may provide personal data, you're now protected under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.

If your company is neither in the U.S. nor the EU and does not use its PASS Training & Compliance account to do business with EU citizens, these agreements do not apply to you.

## Where can I find additional information about PASS Training & Compliance security?
