# Taxes!

PASS Training & Compliance is required to collect and remit sales tax in a number of US states and localities. Not all states tax the sale of software as a service (SaaS), but it's becoming increasingly common. If your state is on the list below, you'll see a line item on your monthly invoice for sales tax. The rate being collected on your invoice is determined by your billing address.

You'll see sales tax on your invoice if you live in:

* Chicago (Illinois)
* Washington
* Hawaii
* South Dakota

If you need to change your billing information because you don't actually reside in a taxable state, you can easily handle that. Give us a call or drop an email to [support@passtesting.com](mailto:support@passtesting.com) if:

* you believe you're being charged in error.
* your business is sales tax exempt. Include your tax exempt certificate and your PASS Training & Compliance account number (passtesting.com/<span class="highlight">1234567</span>) when you email Support.
* you have any additional questions.
