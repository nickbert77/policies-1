# UST Class A/B/C Operator Training Reciprocity policy.

Reciprocity is hard to track â€” some states accept it, while others don't, and more often
than not it requires express written approval from the regulator.

When one training takes the place of another, it creates opportunities for a trainee to think that all rules in
one state are the same as the other, when in reality these rules can be different. This assumption creates a liability that
does not align with the qualities and standards that we hold for our trainees.

For these reasons, PASS Training & Compliance does not handle or aid in any reciprocity requests
or suggest that our customers use this method. If a customer wishes to pursue reciprocity they must
 pursue the request directly with the state(s) regulatory agency.
